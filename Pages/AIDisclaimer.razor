				I am deeply interested in artificial intelligence and its rapid evolution. It is a powerful and nuanced technology, advancing at an exponential pace, and I am intentionally developing mastery in its responsible use.

				Much of my personal work is AI-augmented. I view AI the same way I view any other engineering tool: something to be understood, constrained, and applied with judgment. The value is not in replacing thinking, but in reducing unnecessary friction so meaningful work can move forward.

				For much of my career, I carried a lot of potential while quietly struggling with executive function challenges and undiagnosed neurodivergence. Progress often felt less like solving hard problems and more like stepping on Legos—small points of friction that compounded and slowed momentum. AI has helped smooth those edges: assisting with organization, focus, and translation from intent to execution. For me, it has been the difference between having ideas and consistently shipping work.

				There is a perception that using AI is "doing it the wrong way." I don't share that view. Engineers have always relied on tools to reduce friction and increase leverage. AI is simply the next step in that lineage, and choosing not to engage with it is not a substitute for rigor.

				At the same time, I am deeply concerned with responsible AI usage. This technology demands nuance, transparency, and accountability. I am intentional about understanding its limitations, avoiding over-delegation of judgment, and maintaining clear ownership of the work I produce.
